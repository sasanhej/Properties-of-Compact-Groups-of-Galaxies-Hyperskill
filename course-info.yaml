title: Properties of Compact Groups of Galaxies
language: English
summary: <p>Most galaxies in the Universe are found as highly-dense groups or clusters.
  The densest and the most populous are galaxy clusters — they may contain 50+ relatively
  bright galaxies in the area of a few megaparsecs. Smaller aggregations are called
  groups and compact groups (CGs). Compact groups are of particular interest for studying
  galaxy merging and the properties of interacting galaxies. This project presents
  an opportunity to be an astrophysicist. Discover interesting properties of compact
  groups with the statistical methods of Python. Don't worry if you're completely
  new to the field of astrophysics — we'll explain all the important concepts and
  provide you with the tips to help you navigate. But be ready to learn a lot of new
  information!</p><br/><br/>Learn more at <a href="https://hyperskill.org/projects/249?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide&utm_campaign=ide&utm_content=project-card">https://hyperskill.org/projects/249</a>
